> yazcode continues the **ZCode → ZCodium → yazcode** lineage: ZCode is Z.ai's coding agent, open-sourced on September 21, 2026; ZCodium is the community audit fork that stripped monitoring, telemetry and vendored services; yazcode independently continues that work under its own name. Everything here is backed by code and reproducible checks — see [Lineage](#lineage-zcode--zcodium--yazcode) for the full relationship.

## Lineage: ZCode → ZCodium → yazcode

| Project | Repository | What it is |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **ZCode** | [zai-org/ZCode](https://github.com/zai-org/ZCode) | Z.ai's coding agent, open-sourced by Zhipu on September 21, 2026. The origin of everything here. |
| **ZCodium** | [ZCodium-project/ZCodium](https://github.com/ZCodium-project/ZCodium) | The community audit fork: monitoring and telemetry removed, vendored services off by default. Its development pace stalled, so yazcode continues the work. |
| **yazcode** | this repository | Independent continuation of ZCodium under its own name: own data directory (`~/.yazcode`), own env prefix (`YAZCODE_*`), own protocol (`yazcode://`), and the Zhipu subscription system fully removed. |

How the three relate in practice:

- yazcode tracks **both** upstreams as git remotes (`zcode` → zai-org/ZCode, `zcodium` → ZCodium-project/ZCodium). Upstream changes are audited before any risk-free ones are synced.
- Product-level decisions (the data-directory rename, de-Zhipu work) stay **yazcode-only**; uncontroversial fixes and small features are still sent back to ZCodium as PRs.
- User data lives in `~/.yazcode` — migrated automatically on first run from legacy `~/.zcode` (official client) or `~/.zcodium` (early yazcode builds).

## Features

yazcode keeps the product itself — an AI coding workspace for desktop, browser and terminal — and rebuilds it from the public source with monitoring and telemetry removed and vendor services off by default.

- **One Agent, three interfaces**: the Electron desktop app, the browser workspace and the `yazcode` terminal TUI share the same Agent runtime and sessions; you can also connect to a remote host over SSH, or drive the same desktop agent from your phone's browser.
- **Plans, edits, runs, verifies**: file changes arrive as diffs, terminal commands carry their context, the agent checks its own work by running commands and tests, and a built-in browser plugin drives a real browser for web tasks.
- **Asks before it touches your project**: every edit, command and tool call can require approval — allow once, always in this project, or full access.
- **Multi-agent collaboration and orchestration**: sub-agents, dynamic workflows, skills and scheduled automations.
- **Plugins, skills and MCP**: built-in skills plus a plugin system; official MCP and the plugin marketplace stay off by default, each with its own switch.
- **Bring your own model**: built-in presets for DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Moonshot Kimi, MiniMax, Z.AI (GLM), Alibaba, xAI, Xiaomi MiMo and OpenRouter, plus fully custom endpoints (Chat Completions, Responses, Anthropic Messages).

| Issues and collaboration | **Open** — issues and discussions welcome                                            | Not open                                                                  | Closed                           |

## What yazcode changes vs. official ZCode

Compared with the upstream open-source release:

- **Vendor services off by default**: account sign-in, feedback, coding plans, official MCP and the plugin marketplace are all off by default, each with its own switch in Settings. Turning one on connects to ZCode's official servers — keep them off unless you need them.
- **Deleted all monitoring and telemetry**, about 26k lines: ARMS RUM, OTLP reporting, crash collection, resource and network sampling, UI instrumentation. Regression checks keep those exits from coming back (see "What we removed" below).
- **Searched the sensitive paths**: snapshot packaging, encryption, and direct-upload code was reviewed across the repository; this version has no unconsented data egress.
- **Wired up builds and releases**: GitHub Actions builds the installers and deploys this site; in-app updates point at this repo's GitHub Releases.

The audit is a static code search, not full dynamic forensics. Findings and limits will be updated.

## We keep auditing

- Every commit in [zai-org/ZCode](https://github.com/zai-org/ZCode) gets a diff audit, not just releases.
- Only risk-free changes are synced. Code that does data egress, monitoring/telemetry, or permission expansion is stripped or rejected, with the reason recorded.
- Every sync is followed by a rebuild and a new audited release (see [Releases](https://github.com/ZCodium-project/ZCodium/releases)).
- Audit methods and conclusions stay in this repository and on the [project site](https://zcodium-project.github.io/). Review and challenge are welcome.

## What we removed

Compared with the upstream open-source release, this repository contains **no monitoring or telemetry implementation**:

| Area                        | Removed                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client monitoring SDK       | Alibaba Cloud ARMS RUM (`@arms/rum-electron`), its patch, initialization, route instrumentation, and renderer bridges                                   |
| Usage and network telemetry | Network metric aggregation and reporting, API event ingestion, host/scheduler forwarding, remote-session usage sampling                                 |
| Resource and performance    | Periodic resource sampling, memory diagnostics, data-size stats, TTFT export, MCP telemetry                                                             |
| Crash collection            | Crash dump reporting, OOM annotations, stability telemetry                                                                                              |
| CLI telemetry               | The entire `@zcode/telemetry` package (OTLP export, model API recording, agent metrics and traces)                                                      |
| UI instrumentation          | All session-open, subscription-error, automation, prompt-template, and user-action instrumentation, plus the platform reporting methods and IPC bridges |
| Protocol and configuration  | Telemetry event protocols and reporting paths; added filtering so legacy telemetry environment variables cannot re-enter the agent                      |

**Kept on purpose**: local logs (for troubleshooting), user-initiated feedback, and normal business requests (model calls, update checks). The device identifier is used only for business identity and local locks.

**Verification**: the change passes `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` (0 errors), and per-module regression tests. Full lists and verification limits are in the removal reports: [desktop](packages/desktop/specs/telemetry-removal-report.md), [CLI](apps/zcode-cli/specs/telemetry-removal-report.md), [UI](packages/ui/specs/telemetry-removal-report.md).

## Download and install

The [Releases](https://github.com/ZCodium-project/ZCodium/releases) page ships desktop clients (macOS / Windows / Linux) and the CLI distribution.

**About signing**: the builds are **not signed by ZCode**, so the operating system blocks the first launch. That is expected — allow it once per platform as below. Before allowing it you can verify the download against the `sha256.txt` on the release page — it covers every installer, the CLI package and `install.sh` (update metadata and remote runtime assets carry their own checksums). Compute the file hash with `shasum -a 256 <file>` (macOS), `sha256sum <file>` (Linux) or `certutil -hashfile <file> SHA256` (Windows) and compare it with the matching line.

### macOS (.dmg)

1. Download `yazcode-*-mac-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or `yazcode-*-mac-x64.dmg` (Intel), open it and drag yazcode into Applications.
2. The app is not signed by ZCode, so Gatekeeper will say the developer cannot be verified (or that the app is damaged). **After dragging the app into Applications**, run the command below (enter your login password when asked; nothing is shown while typing):

   ```bash
   # One-time command (unblocks and launches; it exits immediately):
   sudo /usr/bin/xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/yazcode.app" && open -a "yazcode"
   ```

   The absolute `/usr/bin/xattr` path avoids shadowing by other tools with the same name (for example the Python xattr package), which fail with "option -r not recognized". Alternatively, right-click (Control-click) the app in Finder → Open → click Open again in the dialog. Afterwards it launches normally with a double-click.

### Windows (.exe)

1. Download `yazcode-*-win-x64.exe` and double-click it.
2. The installer is not signed by ZCode, so SmartScreen shows the "Windows protected your PC" warning. Click **More info** → **Run anyway** and finish the installer.

   This is the expected prompt, not a sign of corruption; you can also verify the installer against the `sha256.txt` from the release page first, e.g. `certutil -hashfile yazcode-<version>-win-x64.exe SHA256` compared with the matching line.

### Linux (.AppImage)

Pick the build that matches your CPU architecture: `yazcode-*-linux-x86_64.AppImage` (Intel / AMD) or `yazcode-*-linux-arm64.AppImage` (arm64 / aarch64).

```bash
# x86_64 (Intel / AMD)
chmod +x yazcode-*-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./yazcode-*-linux-x86_64.AppImage

# arm64 (aarch64)
chmod +x yazcode-*-linux-arm64.AppImage
./yazcode-*-linux-arm64.AppImage
```

### CLI distribution (.tar.gz)

The CLI distribution is a self-contained bundle (TUI + Web + Agent) and needs Node.js 24; the install script and runtime code can both be reviewed in this repository:

```bash
tar -xzf yazcode-*.tar.gz
cd yazcode
./install.sh        # installs the yazcode command (defaults to ~/.yazcode/runtime, entry in ~/.local/bin)
yazcode --help      # or run directly: node bin/zcode.mjs --help
```

## Build and Release

- **GitHub builds**: audited code is built in this repository with GitHub Actions. CLI distributions are published to [Releases](https://github.com/ZCodium-project/ZCodium/releases), and the project site is built in [its own repository](https://github.com/ZCodium-project/zcodium-project.github.io) and served at https://zcodium-project.github.io/. Every artifact comes from the audited source in this repository and contains no unsynced upstream changes.
- **Release flow**: run the [Release](https://github.com/ZCodium-project/ZCodium/actions/workflows/release.yml) workflow manually in Actions. Enter `3.14.0` with pre-release checked to get `3.14.0-audit.<date>` (repeat builds on the same day get `.2`, `.3`, …; the full form `3.14.0-audit.20260922[.2]` is also accepted). With pre-release unchecked it publishes the stable `v3.14.0` (clean tag, GitHub Latest, so `/releases/latest` works). Release notes always lead with "what changed vs ZCode", then the install steps — the English block first, an exact Chinese mirror below — and the downloads list last. Every artifact is uploaded into a **draft** release first; the release is published only after the CLI and all desktop platform artifacts are uploaded, and a failed build leaves it as a draft, so download pages never resolve to a still-building version.
- **Upstream sync**: review the change first, diff-audit it per version, and merge only the risk-free parts; conclusions go into the audit record.

# Official ZCode README (upstream content below)

> **Note**: the sections below come from the official upstream repository [zai-org/ZCode](https://github.com/zai-org/ZCode) README and describe the upstream project itself. Its community links, services, and commitments are maintained by upstream and are not part of this audit fork.

---

ZCode is an AI coding workspace with desktop, browser, and terminal interfaces. This repository contains the clients, backend services, shared UI, and Agent CLI and runtime source code.

| Interface                    | Purpose                                                                                   | Development command            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Desktop                      | Electron desktop application                                                              | `pnpm dev:desktop`             |
| Web / ZCode CLI distribution | Terminal and browser workspace; packages the TUI, Web client, backend, and Agent together | `pnpm dev:web`                 |
| Agent CLI                    | The `yazcode` terminal interface, which also provides the Agent runtime for Desktop and Web | `pnpm --filter @zcode/cli dev` |

## Setup

Install Git, Node.js **24.14.0**, and pnpm **10.33.2**. [mise.toml](mise.toml) is the source of truth for tool versions. Run all development and packaging commands below from the repository root.

```bash
pnpm bootstrap
```

`pnpm bootstrap` installs workspace dependencies, prepares local desktop runtime assets, and runs `build:bootstrap`.

The Agent CLI and runtime source code lives in [apps/zcode-cli/](apps/zcode-cli/) as a regular directory included when you clone this repository. No separate checkout or Git submodule initialization is required.

Additional setup and build commands:

| Command                        | Purpose                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`                 | Install dependencies                                                                                                                |
| `pnpm prepare:desktop-runtime` | Prepare desktop runtime assets, including remote assets by default                                                                  |
| `pnpm prepare:remote-assets`   | Prepare remote runtime assets separately                                                                                            |
| `pnpm bootstrap:with-remote`   | Set up dependencies and local and remote assets, then build the relevant packages sequentially; skip the desktop application bundle |
| `pnpm build`                   | Recursively run each workspace package's build script, including its asset preparation steps                                        |

The default `bootstrap` skips remote asset preparation and is suitable for local desktop development. Run the corresponding preparation command when working with remote workspaces or validating remote distribution assets.

## Development and Usage

### Desktop

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop

# Use the test environment
pnpm dev:desktop:test
```

`pnpm dev:desktop` defaults to `pnpm dev:desktop:prod` and uses production service configuration. The startup script prepares local runtime assets, builds the desktop Agent, then starts Electron and source watchers.

Set `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR` to use a separate development data directory. For example, on macOS / Linux:

```bash
YAZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR="$HOME/.zcode-dev-home" pnpm dev:desktop:test
```

### Web Development

Use development mode when editing Web or backend source code:

```bash
pnpm dev:web

# Set the backend workspace (macOS / Linux)
ZCODE_SERVER_WORKSPACE=/path/to/project pnpm dev:web
```

This starts both the Web development server (default: `http://localhost:5173`) and the backend (default: `http://localhost:3030`). Open the Web development server in your browser. `/ws` and general `/api` requests are proxied to the local backend; `/api/v1/oauth/token` is proxied separately to the configured product service.

After changing Agent source code, run `pnpm --filter @zcode/cli... build` and restart the service. To validate the complete distribution, extract and run it as described under Packaging → ZCode CLI distribution below.

### ZCode CLI distribution

The command-line distribution includes the TUI, Web client, and Agent behind one `yazcode` command. With no arguments it starts the TUI; a leading `--web` starts Web mode; all other arguments go to the existing Agent CLI. Both modes run locally without Electron.

```bash
# Start the terminal UI by default
yazcode

# Start the Web interface
yazcode --web

# Set the project and port without opening a browser automatically
yazcode --web --workspace /path/to/project --port 3030 --no-open

# Show CLI or Web options
yazcode --help
yazcode --web --help
```

In Web mode, it uses the current directory as the workspace, listens on `127.0.0.1` without token authentication by default, selects an available port, and opens a browser. Use the URL printed in the terminal and press `Ctrl+C` to stop the service. For LAN access, use `--host 0.0.0.0`; listening on a non-local address generates an access token by default. Use the token-bearing URL printed in the terminal. Set a token with `--token`, or disable token authentication with `--no-token`.

When starting the general Web service's HTTP entry directly, configure API/WebSocket authentication with `ZCODE_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`. When creating the service programmatically, use the `authToken` option.

See Packaging below for build instructions. `pnpm build:zcode` only creates the distribution; it does not replace an existing `zcode` on `PATH`. If the command still points to an older installation or another checkout, check it with `command -v zcode` on macOS / Linux or `where.exe zcode` on Windows.

### CLI Source Development

Use the source entry when developing the TUI or Agent:

```bash
pnpm --filter @zcode/cli dev --help
pnpm --filter @zcode/cli dev

# Build the CLI and its workspace dependencies
pnpm --filter @zcode/cli... build
node apps/zcode-cli/packages/cli/dist/zcode.cjs --help
```

This entry runs the Agent CLI directly and does not handle the distribution's `--web` switch. Use `pnpm dev:web` for Web development, or the extracted `bin/zcode.mjs` shown below to test the unified command.

## Configuration

The root [.env.example](.env.example) provides sample service URLs and build configuration. Copy it to `.env` as needed and place local overrides in `.env.local`. Select the Desktop development environment with `dev:desktop:test` or `dev:desktop:prod`.

| Setting                              | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR`                | Base directory for application data, stored under its `.zcode/` subdirectory            |
| `ZCODE_SERVER_WORKSPACE`             | Workspace path for the Web backend                                                      |
| `ZCODE_BUILTIN_PROVIDER_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to a local provider configuration file; uses the built-in configuration when unset |
| `ZCODE_DIST_BASE_URL`                | Download base URL used by the CLI distribution installer                                |

Runtime variables can be set explicitly in the environment of the startup command. See [config/README.md](config/README.md) for the default configuration shipped with the client.

## Packaging

See [third-party/README.md](third-party/README.md) for notice generation, distribution checks, and where the notices are included in each distribution.

### Desktop

```bash
pnpm bundle:desktop

# Set the target platform and CPU architecture
pnpm bundle:desktop -- --os win --arch x64

pnpm bundle:desktop -- --help
```

The default target is macOS arm64, and the default output directory is `packages/desktop/dist/`. `--os` accepts `mac`, `win`, or `linux`; `--arch` accepts `x64` or `arm64`. Packaging and signing require the tools and configuration for the target platform.

### ZCode CLI distribution

Run `pnpm build:zcode` to build the CLI/TUI, backend, and Web client, collect the TUI native libraries, workers, and runtime dependencies, then assemble the distribution. Running the distribution still requires Node.js; use the version specified in `mise.toml`.

Before packaging, set the download base URL with `ZCODE_DIST_BASE_URL` in `.env`, `.env.local`, or the process environment, or pass it through `--base-url`. The URL below is a placeholder; replace it with your hosting URL when publishing:

```bash
pnpm build:zcode --base-url https://downloads.example.com/zcode/

# When ZCODE_DIST_BASE_URL is already configured
pnpm build:zcode

# Repackage existing Agent, backend, and Web build outputs
pnpm build:zcode --skip-build

# Show options for the version, output directory, and more
pnpm build:yazcode --help
```

The version defaults to the root `package.json` version. Output is written to `dist/zcode/`:

- `releases/<version>/zcode-<version>.tar.gz`: runtime package.
- `releases/<version>/sha256.txt`: checksum file.
- `latest.json` and `install.sh`: version index and installer.

Upload the entire directory to the configured download base URL. The installer downloads the runtime package from that URL, installs it to `~/.zcode/runtime` by default, and creates the `zcode` command in `~/.local/bin`. Override these directories with `ZCODE_DIST_HOME` and `ZCODE_DIST_BIN_DIR`, respectively.

Existing Lite users should switch to the new build command, environment variables, and installer. Installation does not remove old Lite directories or migrate/delete session data.

To test a packaged build locally, extract and run it directly without uploading or installing it:

```bash
zcode_version=$(node -p "require('./dist/zcode/latest.json').version")
mkdir -p dist/zcode/debug
tar -xzf "dist/zcode/releases/$zcode_version/zcode-$zcode_version.tar.gz" \
  -C dist/zcode/debug
# Start the TUI by default
node dist/zcode/debug/zcode/bin/zcode.mjs

# Start Web mode
node dist/zcode/debug/zcode/bin/zcode.mjs --web \
  --workspace "$PWD" --port 3030 --no-open
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3030` to validate the complete flow, with one backend serving the Web pages and running the Agent. The port must be available; if `pnpm dev:web` is already running, choose another `--port`.
